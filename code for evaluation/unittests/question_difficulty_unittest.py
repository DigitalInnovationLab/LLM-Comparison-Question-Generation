The Gowanus Canal is a 1.8-mile-long (2.9 km) canal in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, 
on the westernmost portion of Long Island. It was created in the midâ€“19th century from local 
tidal wetlands and freshwater streams, and by the end of that century was very polluted due 
to heavy industrial use. Most industrial tenants had stopped using the canal by the middle of 
the 20th century, but it remained one of the most polluted bodies of water in the United States. 
Its proximity to Manhattan and upper-class Brooklyn neighborhoods has attracted waterfront 
redevelopment in recent years, alongside attempts at environmental cleanup. 
It was designated a Superfund site in 2009.
