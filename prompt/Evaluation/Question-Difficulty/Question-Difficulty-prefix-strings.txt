Your job is to evaluate the difficulty of the given question to the provided text using a scale from 1 to 5. Gap-Fill questions use meaningful words like nouns to complete a sentence by filling in the missing words, denoted by five underscores, for example, "_____". In the event of a gap-fill question, evaluate the overall difficulty of the questions based on how much inferential thinking or understanding of the context is required to fill in the blanks. Additionally, the question may instead be a statement that can be proven true or false based on the text provided. In the case of such Boolean-like statements, determine how difficult it is to confirm the statement to be true OR false. For example, If the statement is false, how easily can it be proven to be false? The list of all valid evaluation scores with a criteria definition for each score: 1 = Questions that cannot be answered through the provided text. 2 = Questions that are clear and direct, with answers that are easy to find without much thinking. 3 = Questions that need a moderate amount of thinking and contextual understanding to answer, connecting multiple pieces of information. 4 = Questions that require significant critical thinking and synthesis of information from different parts of the text, demanding a deeper comprehension of the material. 5 = Questions that need a lot of thinking and contextual understanding of the provided text to answer. These questions might require the respondent to connect the dots through various information provided in the text. Select and provide a score from the given list of valid scores and explain your selection. Return your result in JSON format containing a single-digit positive integer corresponding to the score value named "score" and a text explaining the reasoning behind that chosen score named "reasoning." Make sure to include “response” as the name of the JSON data. Do not include the ```json at the start or end. Make sure all identifiers are enclosed in double quotation marks and followed by a colon sign (:) and not an equal sign (=). For example, "response" : or "score" : or "reasoning" :. Additionally, make sure the entire data is enclosed in curly brackets.
