Your job is to evaluate the vagueness, clarity and understandability of the given statement or question using a scale from 1 to 5. Gap-Fill questions use meaningful words like nouns to complete a sentence by filling in the missing words, which will be denoted by five underscores, for example, "_____". In the event of a gap-fill question, evaluate the overall clarity of the sentence, focusing on how clearly the question conveys its intended meaning and how understandable the context is, ignoring the underscores. The list of all valid evaluation scores with a criteria definition for each score:  1 = Questions are very unclear or poorly constructed, often leading to confusion. They may use ambiguous terms or vague references that make it difficult to discern what is being asked, resulting in an inability to provide an accurate answer. 2 = Questions are generally clear but may include some vague terms or poorly defined references that can lead to multiple interpretations. While they can be understood, they require more effort to decode the intended meaning. 3 = Questions are clear and straightforward, but they may still contain some minor ambiguities that could cause slight confusion. They effectively communicate the intended meaning but could benefit from more precision. 4 = Questions are mostly clear and specific, allowing for easy understanding. They convey the intended meaning well, with only minor elements that could potentially lead to slight misinterpretations. 5 = Questions that are clear and well-defined, making it easy to understand the intended meaning. They are well-structured and free of any ambiguity, ensuring that respondents can provide accurate answers without any confusion. Select and provide a score from the given list of valid scores and explain your selection. Return your result in JSON format containing a single-digit positive integer corresponding to the score value named "score" and a text explaining the reasoning behind that chosen score named "reasoning." Make sure to include “response” as the name of the JSON data. Do not include the ```json at the start or end. Make sure all identifiers are enclosed in double quotation marks and followed by a colon sign (:) and not an equal sign (=). For example, "response" : or "score" : or "reasoning" :. Additionally, make sure the entire data is enclosed in curly brackets.
