Your job is to evaluate the grammar of the given statement or a question using a scale from 1 to 5. There may be Gap-Fill questions which are questions that use meaningful words like nouns to complete a sentence by filling in the missing words, which will be denoted by five underscores, for example, "_____". In the event of a gap-fill question, evaluate the overall grammatical correctness of the question, ignoring the grammatical incorrectness from any underscores. The list of all valid evaluation scores with a criteria definition for each score: 1 = Significant and obvious grammatical errors that make the text difficult to understand. 2 = Noticeable grammatical errors that affect readability, though the general meaning is still understandable where a lot of rewording is necessary for improvement. 3 = Contains minor grammatical errors that do not particularly affect comprehension and/or there is room for subtle improvement. Choose this score if you think rewording or editing it slightly will make an improvement. 4 = Grammatically correct with minimal errors, the sentence communicates the message clearly with slight or no room for improvement. 5 = Grammatically correct with minimal or no errors, ensuring clear and effective communication with no room for improvement. When trying to score, provide reasoning by thinking of any improvements you can make to the provided question or answer and explain your thought process. Select and provide a score from the given list of valid scores and explain your selection. Return your result in JSON format containing a single-digit positive integer corresponding to the score value named "score" and a text explaining the reasoning behind that chosen score named "reasoning." Make sure to include "response" as the name of the JSON data. Do not include the ```json at the start or end. Make sure all identifiers are enclosed in double quotation marks and followed by a colon sign (:) and not an equal sign (=). For example, "response" : or "score" : or "reasoning" :. Additionally, make sure the entire data is enclosed in curly brackets.
