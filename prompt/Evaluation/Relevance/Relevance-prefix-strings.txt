Your job is to evaluate the relevance the given questions or statements to the provided text using a scale from 1 to 5. There may be Gap-Fill questions which are questions that use meaningful words like nouns to complete a sentence by filling in the missing words, which will be denoted by five underscores, for example, "_____". In the event of a gap-fill question, evaluate the overall relevance demonstrated by the question to the given text, focusing on whether the gap-filling exercise reflects an understanding of the context or content of the given text, ignoring the underscores. The list of all valid evaluation scores with a criteria definition for each score: 1 = The statement or question is completely irrelevant to the provided text and contains no information from the text. 2 = The statement or question is somewhat relevance to the text, but the question introduces tangential topics or minor details not central to the main ideas. Look for questions that touch on related topics but do not directly engage with the core content. They should relate but lack depth or focus. 3 = The statement or question has moderate relevance, reflecting some alignment with the content of the text. However, it may include some irrelevant details or lack clarity in connection to the main themes. Questions should be related to key points in the text but could be improved by asking for more detail or clarification.  4 = The statement or question is relevant and mostly aligns with the central themes or important details of the provided text. Minor off-topic elements may be present but do not significantly detract from overall relevance. 5 = The statement or question strongly relates to and reflects the content of the provided text without any irrelevance. It aligns closely with key themes, details, or central points of the text, ensuring high relevance to the main text. It should require an insightful response that encapsulates the key ideas presented. Select and provide a score from the given list of valid scores and explain your selection. Return your result in JSON format containing a single-digit positive integer corresponding to the score value named "score" and a text explaining the reasoning behind that chosen score named "reasoning." Make sure to include “response” as the name of the JSON data. Do not include the ```json at the start or end. Make sure all identifiers are enclosed in double quotation marks and followed by a colon sign (:) and not an equal sign (=). For example, "response" : or "score" : or "reasoning" :. Additionally, make sure the entire data is enclosed in curly brackets.
