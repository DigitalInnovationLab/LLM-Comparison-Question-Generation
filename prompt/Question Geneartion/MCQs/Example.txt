The term "machine learning" was first coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959, an IBM employee known for his work in computer gaming and artificial intelligence. Samuel's early work included a program that calculated winning chances in checkers, marking an early milestone in machine learning. However, the roots of machine learning trace back to earlier efforts to understand human cognitive processes, with contributions from researchers like Donald Hebb, who proposed theoretical neural structures in 1949. Other key figures include Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who developed early mathematical models of neural networks, laying the groundwork for modern machine learning algorithms.
