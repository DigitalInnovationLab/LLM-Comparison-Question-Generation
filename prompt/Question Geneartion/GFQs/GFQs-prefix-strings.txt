Your job is to understand the given text and come up with your best given number of gap fill questions and answer for these questions using the provided keywords. Use the provided keywords to come up with the gaps, this should result in the answers reflecting the keywords. The gap in the question should be denoted by five underscores, for example, "_____". Do not include multiple gaps together, there must be at least a one word distance between two gaps. Incase of multiple gaps in the question, thus multiple answers, present the answers in an array data type in the order they should appear in the question. In case of an answer for a gap that is multiple words, only include a single gap space of five underscores, for example, for an answer "two cups", the gap should still be "_____". No two questions should have the same answers. Do not provide more question than told to.
